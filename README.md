# Questions Answered

1. Can you get banned for this?

    it isn’t malicious. and it can’t be used to gain an advantage over players. this is simply for the look of your cape.
2. How does this script work?

   It grabs the contents of ReplicatedStorage / Assets / Capes and adds them to a dropdown using the Rayfield UI libary. It then proceeds to set    the asset id of the cape via a variable.
